There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

  Renders information feeds, videos, news, stats, temperatures, weather, sushi and ninjas, images and queries onto sides of a three-dimensional shape for your holowatch, portable holodisplay or home holodisplay.

## Summary ##
  > 
  With the dawn of the holographic web upon us.  This prototype which uses the now-obsolete 2015 web era frameworks will act as an elevator to deliver you to the promised land of the holographic web, where UI's, information and the web are decoupled from that rectangular screen that everybody used to stare at all day. Caution: Elevator only holds five at a time.


## Why the hell? ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  This crappy app creates more problems than it solves, generating more jobs, so that the plumbers of the holographic internet have yet one more item to plumb, increasing demand in the labor market, driving unemployment numbers down and thereby foritifying national strength, security and prosperity. World peace, one love.
